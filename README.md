I am a first-year Robotics and Mechatronics Engineering university student with a solid foundation in C programming.

After building a strong understanding of logic and memory in C, I am now focusing on Python to strengthen my skills in automation, robotics software, and real-world engineering applications.

My goal is to build a high-level foundation in Python before starting my second year of university, focusing on automation and freelance development.
